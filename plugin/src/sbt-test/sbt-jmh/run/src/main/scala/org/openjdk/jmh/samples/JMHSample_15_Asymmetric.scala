  /*
   * So far all the tests were symmetric: the same code was executed in all the threads.
   * At times, you need the asymmetric test. JMH provides this with the notion of @Group,
   * which can bind several methods together, and all the threads are distributed among
   * the test methods.
   *
   * Each execution group contains of one or more threads. Each thread within a particular
   * execution group executes one of @Group-annotated @Benchmark methods. Multiple execution
   * groups may participate in the run. The total thread count in the run is rounded to the
   * execution group size, which will only allow the full execution groups.
   *
   * Note that two state scopes: Scope.Benchmark and Scope.Thread are not covering all
   * the use cases here -- you either share everything in the state, or share nothing.
   * To break this, we have the middle ground Scope.Group, which marks the state to be
   * shared within the execution group, but not among the execution groups.
   *
   * Putting this all together, the example below means:
   *  a) define the execution group "g", with 3 threads executing inc(), and 1 thread
   *     executing get(), 4 threads per group in total;
   *  b) if we run this test case with 4 threads, then we will have a single execution
   *     group. Generally, running with 4*N threads will create N execution groups, etc.;
   *  c) each execution group has one @State instance to share: that is, execution groups
   *     share the counter within the group, but not across the groups.
